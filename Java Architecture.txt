                                          Java Architecture

        
 1.Java Architecture is a collection of components.
 2.It integrates the process of interpretation and compilation.
 3.It defines all the processes involved in creating a Java program. 
 4.Java Architecture explains each and every step of how a program is compiled and executed.
   

 * Components of Java Architecture
    The Java architecture includes the three main components:
  1. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
  2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
  3. Java Development Kit (JDK)
   
  * Java Development Kit
    It is a software development environment used in the development of Java applications and applets. 
Java Development Kit holds JRE, a compiler, an interpreter or loader, and several development tools in it.

 * Application of the java
 1.Independent language(WORA)Application
 2.Standalone application
 3.Mobile application
 4.web application.
 5.Enterprise application
 6.Real time system
  

 *Java Runtime Environment
 It provides an environment in which Java programs are executed.
 JRE takes our Java code, integrates it with the required libraries, and then starts the JVM to execute it.
